# PROJECT REPORT: RoomConnect Locator (Room Finder Website)

## 1. Project Brief
RoomConnect Locator is a full-stack web application designed to simplify the process of finding and listing rental rooms. It serves two primary user roles: Owners, who can list and manage properties, and Finders, who can search and filter for their ideal living space.

## 2. Key Features
- **Secure Authentication**: Role-based access for Owners and Finders.
- **Owner Dashboard**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for room listings.
- **Finder Search**: Advanced filtering by location, price, and property type.
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop users.

## 3. Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Built with React and TypeScript, using Tailwind CSS for styling and Shadcn UI for high-quality components.
- **Backend**: A Node.js and Express.js server providing a robust RESTful API.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon.tech) for reliable relational data storage.
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database interactions and automated migrations.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for efficient server-state handling.

## 4. Database Schema
### Users Table
- id (Primary Key)
- email (Unique)
- first_name, last_name
- role (Finder/Owner)

### Listings Table
- id (Primary Key)
- title, description, location
- price (Integer)
- property_type, tenant_preference
- owner_id (Foreign Key referencing Users)

## 5. Design Rationale
- **PostgreSQL**: Selected for its data integrity and support for complex relationships.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Chosen to enable rapid UI development while maintaining a clean, modern aesthetic.
- **Drizzle ORM**: Used to bridge the gap between TypeScript and SQL, ensuring code reliability.

## 6. Deployment Strategy
The application is configured for deployment on Render, with automated database migration scripts included in the build process to ensure zero-downtime schema updates.
